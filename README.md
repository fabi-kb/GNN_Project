# GNN_Project
This repository is intended to serve as a code base for the final project of Ullrich KÃ¶the's lecture "GNNs for the sciences".

## Workflow
### Use of Branches
`main` branch is the protected branch that should always be deployable (code runs without errors, current version we would hand in if asked to do so). New code is always implemented on another branch. 
Often these are called feature branches as they are created to implement a specific feature. In our case it might be enough to have the 3 additional branches `tobi`, `fabian` and `anton` that we use respectively for implementation. If new code runs without errors on the feature branch (and if it is sufficiently commented) the corresponding branch can be merged with the `main` branch. For that don't forget to pull the main branch into the implementation branch before merging for preventing merging conflicts.

### Gitignore file
the `.gitignore` file is used to make git ignore local files which should not be syncronized. For example files that are created during the compiling process of python or the environment which is used to run the code.
I used the standard template for VSCode repositories proviede by github (I don't have any experience with these standard templates yet)

## Code Style
### Enforced by [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
A consistent and common code style is important to make the code more readable and to have meaningful diffs in merge requests where content is changed and not the personal. Therefore it is very important that everyone working on the project also uses Ruff!! 

With PEP-8 Python sets a basic style guide. To apply several parts of code style black, isort, flake8 are combined in a single tool called ruff.

The extension 'autoDocstring' from Nils Werner can be used to efficiently create docstrings compatible with ruff. (e.g. type '"""' directly below the first line of a function and select 'Generate Docstring')
Probably Copilot is the most efficient way to write docstrings though (I didn't test this a lot yet).

## Good Practices
-   regular commits with meaningful commit-messages
-   avoid commiting directly to the `main` branch
-   regularily merge the `main` branch into the branch you are currently working on to detect conflicts early on. At the latest this is very important to be done before merging the branch you have been woring on into the `main` branch! "First `main` into `new_feature_branch` then the other way round to update `main`!"
-   regualarily merge into `main`
-   do testing and documentation before merging into `main`

## Setup
1)  install Git in VSCode
2)  specify user name and e-mail:
    `git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`
3)  colone repo with link https://github.com/TobsTha/GNNs_2024-25.git
4)  add a gitignore enty so that your environment for the project is ignored from git during syncronization if you use an environment named differently than `.venv` (for example `.conda`).
